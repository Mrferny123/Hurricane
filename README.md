# Hurricane Helper

I made this app to help others, especially Floridan residents, with hurricane tips and resources.
This project was made using Swift, Landbot.io, and National Weather's API.
In this project I learned a lot more about how APIs work and how to integrate websites into Swift applications. I also learned
more about how to design apps with Swift.
One challenge I had during the creation of this app was figuring out how to put interactive markers on a map view, however, with many youtube videos
and documentation tabs later, I eventually figured it out.

This mobile app consists of 4 pages:

## 🧾 To-Do Checklist

-Simple checklist of tips to prepare before a hurricane

-Tasks can be checked on or off and are saved even after exiting the app

## 🤖 AI Chatbot

-Built using Landbot.io, integrated with WebKit

## 🌤️ Real-Time Alerts

-Pulls live weather alerts for Florida from the National Weather Service API

## 🏠 Shelter Finder

-Displays nearby Florida shelters on an interactive map

-Tapping a shelter opens it in Apple Maps for directions
